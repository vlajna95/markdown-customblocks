This [Python-Markdown] extension defines
a common markup for parametrizable and nestable components that can be extended by defining a plain Python function.

Includes some sample components for div containers, admonitions, figures, link cards... and embeds from common sites (youtube, vimeo, twitter...)

## What is it?

This extension parses markup structures like this one:

```markdown
::: mytype "value 1" param2=value2
    Indented content
```

delegating the HTML generation to custom functions (generators)
you can define or redefine for the type (`mytype`, in the example) to suit your needs.
For example, we could bind `mytype` to this generator:

```python
def mygenerator(ctx, param1, param2):
    """Quick and dirty generator, needs escaping"""
    return f"""<div attrib1="{param1}" attrib2="{param2}">{ctx.content}</div>"""
```

and the previous markdown will generate:

```html
<div attrib1="value 1" attrib2="value2">Indented Content</div>
```

The extension also provides several useful generators:

- `container`: A classed div with arbitrary classes, attributes and content (This is the default when no type matches)
- `figure`: Figures with caption and more
- `admonition`: Admonitions (quite similar to the [standard extra extension][ExtraAdmonitions])
- `twitter`: Embeded tweets
- `youtube`: Embeded videos from youtube...
- `vimeo`: Embeded videos from vimeo...
- `linkcard`: External link cards (like Facebook and Twitter do, when you post a link)
- `verkami`: Fund raising project widget in [Verkami]
- `goteo`: Fund raising project widget in [Goteo]

[ExtraAdmonitions]: https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/admonition/

They are examples, you can always rewrite them to suit your needs.

## Why this?

Markdown, has a quite limited set of structures,
and you often end up writing html by hand:
A figure, an embed...
If you use that structure multiple times,
whenever you find a better way,
you end up updating the structures in multiple places.
That's why you should use (or develop) a markdown extension to ease the proces.

There is a catch.
Each markdown extension has to identify its own markup.
For new extensions, is hard to find a handy markup that no other extension is using yet.
Because of that, the trend is having a lot of different markups,
even for extensions sharing purpose.
When you find a better extension for your figures,
again, it is likely you have to edit all your figures, once more,
because the markup is different.

Also coding an extension is hard.
Markdown extension API is required to be complex to address many other scenarios.
But this extension responds just to this common scenario:

> I want to generate this **piece of html** which
> depends on those **parameters** and maybe it should
> include a given **content**.

**So, why am i using a common markup for all those structures?** \
This way, markup syntax explosion is avoided,
and users do not have to learn a new syntax.
Besides, developing new block types is easier if you can reuse the same parser.

**So, why am i using a type name to identify the structure?** \
A name as part of the markup clarifies the block meaning on reading.
Also provides a hook to change the behaviour while keeping the semantics.

**So, why am i defining a common attribute markup?** \
This way, a general mapping from such attributes to the parameters
of a Python function can be stablished.
So, the generator function signature defines the attributes that can be used
and the extension does the mapping with no extra glue required.

**So, why am i using indentation to define inner content?** \
It visually shows the scope of the block and allows nesting.
If the content is reparsed as Markdown,
it could still include other components with their inner content a level down.

We all stand on giants' shoulders so take a look at the [long list](doc/inspiration.md)
of markdown extensions and other software that inspired and influenced ideas for this extension.
Kudos for all of them.


## Installation and setup

To install:

```bash
$ pip install markdown-customblocks
```

In order to enable it in Markdown:

```python
MARKDOWN = {
    'extensions': [
        'customblocks',
    ],
}
```

## General markup syntax

This is a more complete example of custom block usage:

```markdown
::: mytype param1 key1=value1 "param with many words" key2="value2 with words"
    Indented **content**

    The block ends whenever the indentation stops
This unindented line is not considered part of the block
```

The line starting with `:::` is the _headline_.
It specifies, first, the block type (`mytype`) followed by a set of _values_.
Such values can be either single worded or quoted.
Also some values may explicit a target parameter with a _key_.

After the _headline_, several lines of indented _content_ may follow,
and the block ends at the very first line back to the previous indentation.
Emtpy lines are included and there is no need of an empty line to end the block.

> By using indentation you don't need a closing tag,
> but if you miss it, you might place a closing `:::` at the same
> level of the headline.

A block type may interpret the content as markdown as well.
So you can have nested blocks by adding extra indentation.
For example:

```markdown
::: recipe
    # Sweet water
    ::: ingredients "4 persons"
        - two spons of suggar
        - a glass of tap water
    ::: mealphoto sweetwater.jpg
        Looks gorgeus!
    Drop the suggar into the glass. Stir.
```

## Implementing a generator

A block type can be defined just by hooking the **generator** function to the type.

```python
MARKDOWN = {
    ...
    'extensions_configs': {
        'customblocks': {
            'generators': {
                # by direct symbol reference
                'mytype': myparentmodule.mymodule.mytype,
                # or using import strings (notice the colon)
                'aka_mytype': 'myparentmodule.mymodule:mytype',
            }
        },
    },
}
```


The signature of the generator will determine the attributes taken from the headline.

```python
def mytype(ctx, param1, myflag:bool, param2, param3, yourflag=True, param4='default2'):
    ...
```

The first parameter, `ctx`, is the context.
If you don't use it, you can skip it.
But it is useful if you want to receive some context parameters like:

- `ctx.parent`: the parent node
- `ctx.content`: the indented part of the block, with the indentation removed
- `ctx.parser`: the markdown parser, can be used to parse the inner content or any other markdown code
- `ctx.type`: the type of the block
    - If you reuse the same function for different types, this is how you diferentiate them
- `ctx.metadata`: A dictionary with metadata from your metadata plugin.
- `ctx.config`: A dictionary passed from `extension_configs.customblocks.config`

Besides `ctx`, the rest of function parameters are filled using values parsed from _head line_.
Unlike Python, you can interleave in the headline values with and without keys.
They are resolved as follows:

- **Explicit key:** When a key in the headline matches a keyable parameter name in the generator, the value is assigned to it
- **Flag:** Generator arguments annotated as `bool` (like example's `myflag`), or defaulting to `True` or `False`, (like example's `yourflag`) are considered flags
    - When a keyless value matches a flag name in the generator (`myflag`), `True` is passed
    - When it matches the flag name prefixed with `no` (`nomyflag`), `False` is passed
- **Positional:** Remaining headline values and function parameters are assigned one-to-one by position
- **Restricted:** Restrictions on how to receive the values ([keyword-only] and [positional-only]) are respected and they will receive only values from either key or keyless values
- **Varidics:** If the signature contains key (`**kwds`) or positional (`*args`) varidic variables, any remaining key and keyless values from the headline are assigned to them

Following Markdown phylosophy, errors are warned but do not stop the processing, so:

- Unmatched function parameters without a default value will be warned and assigned an empty string.
- Unused headline values will be warned and ignored.

[keyword-only]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/
[positional-only]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0570/

A generator can use several strategies to generate content:

- Return an html string (single root node)
- Return a `markdown.etree` `Element` object
- Manipulate `ctx.parent` to add the content and return `None`

In order to construct an ElementTree,
we recommend using the [Hyperscript utility](#hyperscript-generation).
Resulting code will be more compact and readable and
makes proper escaping when injecting values.

## Predefined generators

### Container (`customblocks.generators.container`)

This is the default generator when no other generator matches the block type.
It can be used to generate html div document structure with markdown.

It creates a `<div>` element with the type name as class.
Keyless values are added as additional classes and
key values are added as attributes for the `div` element.

`*args`
: added as additional classes for the outter div

`**kwds`
: added as attributes for the outter div


The following example:

```markdown
::: sidebar left style="width: 30em"
    ::: widget
        # Social
        ...
    ::: widget
        # Related
        ...
```

Renders as:

```html
<div class='sidebar left' style="width: 30em">
    <div class='widget'>
        <h1>Social</h1>
        <p>...</p>
    </div>
    <div class='widget'>
        <h1>Related</h1>
        <p>...</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Admonition (`customblocks.generators.admonition`)

An admonition is a specially formatted text out of the main flow
which remarks a piece of text, often in a box or with a side
icon to identify it as that special type of text.

Admonition generator is, by default, assigned to the following types:
`attention`, `caution`, `danger`, `error`, `hint`, `important`, `note`, `tip`, `warning`.

So you can write:

```markdown
::: danger
    Do not try to do this at home
```

In order to generate:

```html
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Danger</p>
<p>Do not try to do this at home</p>
</div>
```

Generated code emulates the one generated by ReST admonitions
(which is also emulated by `markdown.extra.admonition`).
So, you can benefit from existing styles and themes.

`title`
: in the title box show that text instead of the 

`*args`
: added as additional classes for the outter div

`**kwds`
: added as attributes for the outter div

**Warning:**
If you are migrating from `extra.admonition`,
be careful as `extra` identifies title using the quotes,
while `customblocks` will take the first parameter as title and next values as additional classes.
If you like having the classes before, you should explicit the `title` key.

```markdown
::: danger blinking title="Super danger"
    Do **not** try to do this at home
```

### Figure (`customblocks.generators.figure`)

An image as captioned figure.
The content is taken as caption.

`url`
: the url to the image

`alt` (keyword only)
: image alt attribute

`title` (keyword only)
: image title attribute

`*args`
: additional classes for root `<figure>` tag

`**kwds`
: additional attributes for root `<figure>` tag




### Link card (`customblocks.generators.linkcard`)

A link card is a informative box about an external source.
It is similar to the card that popular apps like
Wordpress, Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, Slack...
generate when you embed/post a link.

The generator downloads the target url and extracts social [metadata][SocialMeta]:
Featured image, title, description...

[SocialMeta]: https://css-tricks.com/essential-meta-tags-social-media/

```markdown
::: linkcard https://css-tricks.com/essential-meta-tags-social-media/
```

`url`
: The url to embed as card

`wideimage` (Flag, default True)
: Whether the featured image will be shown wide, if not, a small thumb will be shown

Content, if provided will be used as excerpt instead of the summary in the page.

Additionally you can provide the following keyword parameters
to override information extracted from the url:

- `image`: the image heading the card
- `title`: the caption
- `description`: the text describing the link
- `siteurl`: a link to the main site
- `sitename`: the name of the main site
- `siteicon`: the site icon

### Youtube (`customblocks.generators.youtube`)

This generator generates an embeded youtube video.

```markdown
::: youtube HUBNt18RFbo nocontrols left-align
```

`autoplay` (flag, default False)
: starts the video as soon as it is loaded

`loop` (flag, default False)
: restart again the video once finished

`controls` (flag, default True)
: show the controls

`*args`
: added as additional class for the outter div

`**kwds`
: added as attributes for the outter div

Indented content is ignored.

Recommended css:

```css
.videowrapper {
    position:relative;
    padding-bottom:56.25%;
    overflow:hidden;
    height:0;
    width:100%
}
.videowrapper iframe {
    position:absolute;
    left:0;
    top:0;
    width:100%;
    height:100%;
}
```

Or you could set `youtube_inlineFluidStyle` config to `True`
and the style will be added inline to every video.


### Vimeo (`customblocks.generators.vimeo`)

This generator generates an embeded vimeo video.

```markdown
::: vimeo 139579122  nocontrols left-align
```

`autoplay` (flag, default False)
: starts the video as soon as it is loaded

`loop` (flag, default False)
: restart again the video once finished

`bylabel` (flag, default True)
: Shows the video author's name

`portrait` (flag, default False)
: Shows the video author's avatar

`*args`
: added as additional class for the outter div

`**kwds`
: added as attributes for the outter div

Content is ignored.


### Twitter (`customblocks.generators.twitter`)

Embeds a tweet.

```markdown
::: twitter marcmushu 1270395360163307530 theme=dark lang=es track=true
```

`user`:
: the user that wrote the tweet

`tweet`
: the tweet id (a long number)

`theme` (optional, default `light`)
: It can be either `dark` or `light`

`hideimages`
: Do not show attached images in the embedded

`align`
: `left`, `center` or `right`

`conversation`
: whether to add or not the full thread


### Verkami (`customblocks.generators.verkami`)

Embeds a [Verkami] fund raising campaign widget.

[Verkami]: https://www.verkami.com/

```markdown
::: verkami 26588 landscape
```

`id`
: The id of the project (can be the number or the full id)

`landscape` (Flag, default False)
: instead of a portrait widget generate a landscape one


### Goteo (`customblocks.generators.goteo`)

Embeds a [Goteo] fund raising campaign widget.

[Goteo]: https://goteo.org

```markdown
::: goteo my-cool-project
```

`id`
: The id of the project


## Custom generators 

I'm creating my own generators, here they are. :grin: 

### Question (`customblocks.custom_generators.question`)

This generator creates a question with radio buttonsfor every answer, and a button to check if the chosen answer is correct. 
It creates a `div` element as a container, parses the question text as regular markdown, and then creates the inputs with the answers and the button to check the answer. 

#### Parameters 

`correct` (string) 
: The correct answer to the question

`answers` (string) 
: The answers presented to the user. The answers are separated by a vertical bar (\|) and this list must explicitely include the correct answer. The answers will be shuffled.

`unique_name` (string) 
: The unique identifier of the question. It must be formated as a valid JS identifier (in short, no spaces nor dots). 

So, the correct answer and possible answers are added as key/value pairs; all answers (the correct answer appears here, too) go inside a single key/value pair, every answer separated with a \|. 
The last key/value pair is `unique_name="<question name>"` (the name attribute for the answer inputs). It must be **unique** for every question on a page. 

You can pass keyless values. They will be added as classes to the question container div. 

The question text/content must be indented. 

#### Usage 

Add customblocks to your Markdown instance extensions and configure the custom generator. A simple python file could look like this: 

```python
from markdown import Markdown

source = """# Source

Your markdown source text goes here.

::: question correct="Of course!" answers="Sure|Maybe|Of course!" unique_name="loving_markdown"
    Do you like markdown?
"""

md = Markdown(extensions=["customblocks"], extension_configs={
	"customblocks": {
		"generators": {
			"question": "customblocks.custom_generators:question"
		}
	}
}, output_format="html5")

output = md.convert(source)
```

Example markdown 

```markdown
::: question correct="three" answers="two|three|four" name="crazy_numbers" darkgreen-box fg-yellow
    Which is the result of 6 divided by 2?
```

Renders as: 

```html
<div class="question darkgreen-box fg-yellow">
<p>Which is the result of 6 divided by 2? </p>
<div class="answers">
<input id="crazy_numbers_correct" name="crazy_numbers_correct" type="hidden" value="eerht" />
<input id="owt" name="crazy_numbers" type="radio" value="three" />
<label for="owt">two</label><br />
<input id="ruof" name="crazy_numbers" type="radio" value="four" />
<label for="ruof">four</label><br />
<input id="eerht" name="crazy_numbers" type="radio" value="three" />
<label for="eerht">three</label><br />
</div>
<button class="ok" data-correct="crazy_numbers_correct" data-question="crazy_numbers" onclick="checkAnswer(this)" type="button">Answer</button>
</div>
```

In the `onclick="checkAnswer()"` we reference a JavaScript function available somewhere in your base template. It coud look like this: 

```javascript
function checkAnswer(origin) {
var question_name = $(origin).attr("data-question");
var correct_answer_element = $(origin).attr("data-correct");
var correct_answer_id = $("#"+correct_answer_element).val();
var correct_answer_label = $("label[for="+correct_answer_id+"]").text();
var chosen_answer_id = $("input[name="+question_name+"]:checked").attr("id");
var chosen_answer_label = $("label[for="+chosen_answer_id+"]").text();
if(correct_answer_id == chosen_answer_id) {
alert("Correct!");
}
else {
alert("Hmmm... no. \n" + correct_answer_label);
}
$("input[name="+question_name+"]").attr("disabled", true);
}
```

If you copy/paste this in your template, pay atention - it requires jQuery. 

#### To do 

- [ ] Automatically add the correct answer to the list of answers, in order to follow DRY principles 
- [ ] Implement a flag to turn on/off answer shuffling 


## Generator tools

Common code has been extracted from predefined generators.
If you need this functionality you are encouraged to use them.

- Hyperscript: to generate html
- PageInfo: to extract metadata from a webpage
- Fetcher: to download resources with file based cache

### Hyperscript generation

You can generate html with strings or using `etree`; but there is a more elegant option.

[Hyperscript] is the idea of writing code that generates html/xml
as nested function calls that look like the the actual xml structure.
This can be done by using the `customblocks.utils.E` function which has this signature:

```
def E(tag, *children, **attributes): ...
```

`tag` is the name of the tag (`pre`, `div`, `strong`...).
An empty string is equivalent to `div`.
It can have appended several `.classname` that will be added as element class.

Any keyword parameter will be taken as element attributes.
You can use the special `_class` attribute to append more classes.
Notice the underline, as `class` is a reserved word in Python.

`children` takes the keyless parameters and they can be:

- `None`: then it will be ignored
- `dict`: it will be merged with the attributes
- `str`: it will be added as text
- `etree.Element`: it will be added as child node
- `customblocks.utils.Markdown`: will append parsed markdown (see below)
- Any `tuple`, `list` or iterable: will add each item following previous rules

```python
from customblocks.utils import E, Markdown

def mygenerator(ctx, image):
	return (
		E('.mytype',
			dict(style="width: 30%; align: left"),
			E('a', dict(href=image),
				E('img', src=image),
			),
			Markdown(ctx.content, ctx.parser),
		)
	)
```

[Hyperscript]: http://hyperhype.github.io/hyperscript/

### PageInfo

`utils.pageinfo.PageInfo` is a class that retrieves
meta information from html pages by means of its properties.

Properties are cached so you once you use them for one page,
later uses, have litle impact.

Any attribute you explicit on the constructor will override
the ones derived from actual content.

```python
info = PageInfo(html, url='http://site.com/path/page.html')
info.sitename # the name of the site (meta og:site_name or the domain
info.siteicon # the favicon or similar
info.siteurl  # the base url of the site (not the page)
info.title    # page title (from og:title meta or `<title>` content)
info.description # short description (from og:description or twitter:description)
info.image    # featured image (from og:image or twitter:image, or site image)
```

### Fetcher

A fetcher object is a wrapper around the `requests` library
that uses caching to avoid downloading once and again remote resource
each time you compile the markdown file.

The first time a resource is succesfully downloaded by a fetcher
the request response is stored in the provided folder in a yaml file
which has the mangled url as name.
Successive tries to download it just take the content of that file
to construct a query.

```python
from customblocks.utils import Fetcher

fetcher = Fetcher('mycachedir')
response = fetcher.get('https://canvoki.net/codder')
# to force next call
fetcher.remove('https://canvoki.net/codder')
```


## Custom utils :) 

### slugify 

I added a slugify utility which makes my life much easier. 

#### Parameters 

`text` (string) 
: The string to be slugified 

`sep` (string, default="_") 
: The separator put between words 

`case` (string, default="lower_ascii") 
: One of `lower`, `lower_case`, `casefold` 

`percent_encode` (boolean, default=False) 
: Encode non-ascii characters with percent characters 

`normalize` (string, default="NFC")
: Specify the normalization steps

#### Usage 

```python
from customblocks.utils import slugify

id = "my id"
slugified_id = slugify(id) # my_id
dashed_id = slugify(id, sep="-") # my-id
```
